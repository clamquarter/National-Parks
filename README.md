# National Parks

<h3>Summary</h3>
National Parks is a project from my Thinkful Engineering Immersion Intro. A working deployment can be found <a href="https://clamquarter.github.io/thinkful-ei-national-parks/">here</a>. Students were tasked with:<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Popluating a web app's data with API requests.</li>
<li>Using a filtered API request to allow a searching feature.</li>
<li>Allowing a limit on serach results.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<ul>
<li>How to format GET requests to get filtered results.</li>
<li>How to execute code on form submit.</li>
<li>How to navigate GET request results (digging through arrays of arrays of arrays). </li>
</ul>

<h3>What I'd Do Differently</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make the links clickable.</li>
<li>Add a search hint for users--only two letter state codes will deliver results.</li>
<li>Take better notes while building this.</li>
</ul>
